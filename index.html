            <h5>Quoted from Wikipedia:</h5>
            <blockquote>Alexandre Dumas born Dumas Davy de la Pailleterie (24 July 1802 – 5 December 1870), also known as Alexandre Dumas père (where père is French for 'father', thus 'the elder/senior'), was a French writer. His works have been translated into many languages, and he is one of the most widely read French authors. Many of his historical novels of high adventure were originally published as serials, including The Count of Monte Cristo, The Three Musketeers, Twenty Years After, and The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later. His novels have been adapted since the early twentieth century into nearly 200 films.<sup><a href="#dumas_ref">[1]</a></sup></blockquote>

            <img src="flaubert.jpg" alt="Picture of Gustave Flaubert">
            <h5>Quoted from Wikipedia:</h5>
            <blockquote>Gustave Flaubert (12 December 1821 – 8 May 1880) was a French novelist. Highly influential, he has been considered the leading exponent of literary realism in his country. According to the literary theorist Kornelije Kvas, "in Flaubert, realism strives for formal perfection, so the presentation of reality tends to be neutral, emphasizing the values and importance of style as an objective method of presenting reality". He is known especially for his debut novel Madame Bovary (1857), his Correspondence, and his scrupulous devotion to his style and aesthetics. The celebrated short story writer Guy de Maupassant was a protégé of Flaubert.<sup><a href="#flaubert_ref">[2]</a></sup></blockquote>

            <img src="aberg.jpg" alt="Picture of Jon Olof Åberg">
            <h5>Quoted from Wikipedia, translated from Swedish to English:</h5>
            <blockquote>Jon Olof Åberg, born July 2, 1843 in Ås parish, Öland, died May 20, 1898 in Stockholm, was a Swedish author. He was the son of the contract rector in Förlösa Olaus Åberg and Anna Maria Bonell. After a short schooling, he began writing novels and short stories. Since he moved to Stockholm in the 1860s, he published a large number of popularly held descriptions of smaller scope, mainly with action from Swedish history. Through simple language and an ability to use suspense elements, his writing became successful.<sup><a href="#aberg_ref">[4]</a></sup></blockquote>

            <img src="alfthan.jpg" alt="Picture of Johannes Alfthan">
            <h5>Quoted from Wikipedia, translated from Finnish to English:</h5>
            <blockquote>Johannes Alfthan (July 4, 1830 Vyborg - October 20, 1893 Stockholm) was a Finnish journalist, book publisher and author who wrote in Swedish. He released most of his production in Sweden. Alfthan's parents were the Vyborg Wholesaler and Candle Maker, Governor Secretary Anton Alfthan and Helena Schroeder. He attended Vyborg High School and became a student in 1847. Alfthan was expelled from the University of Helsinki after presenting ideas that were too liberal for the authorities in the aftermath of the mad 1848 of Europe. He moved to Vyborg, became a bookseller and publisher in 1851, and published Wiborg magazine in 1855-1860. However, the transactions did not go as expected and so Alfthan eventually sold his printing house, bookstore and newspaper. He settled with his family to inherit his wife's inheritance at Vahvaniemi's house.<sup><a href="#alfthan_ref">[5]</a></sup></blockquote>

            <img src="andersson.jpg" alt="Picture of Dan Andersson">
            <h5>Quoted from Wikipedia:</h5>
            <blockquote>Born in Grangärde parish in the province of Dalarna, Andersson grew up under harsh conditions in the village of Skattlösberg. His father Adolf was a primary school teacher there, and his mother Augusta had also taught in the local school. The village lies in the "Finn Woods" of southern Dalarna, where Forest Finns had immigrated to cultivate new land. On his father's side, Andersson descended from these Finnish settlers. Andersson took odd jobs during the first years of his life, for instance as a forestry worker and school teacher. He found it difficult to make a living. The family considered trying to find a better life in the United States, and Andersson was sent to live in Forest Lake, Minnesota as a 14-year-old in 1902 to see if it would be possible.<sup><a href="#andersson_ref">[6]</a></sup></blockquote>
